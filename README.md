# Logistic Regression 

# Objective
Build a binary classification model using logistic regression to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant.

# Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Dataset
**Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**  
Path used: `C:\Users\TANYA\OneDrive\Desktop\archive\data.csv`  
Source: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)


# Steps Performed

1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Encoded target labels (Malignant = 1, Benign = 0)
3. Split data into training and test sets
4. Standardized features using `StandardScaler`
5. Trained logistic regression model
6. Evaluated with:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
   - ROC Curve and AUC Score

# Model Evaluation

- **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score** were calculated.
- **ROC-AUC Score** was plotted and analyzed.
